# Virtual Lite-Brite

Virtual Lite-Brite is a Ruby on Rails & JavaScript app which is a computer generated version of that 80's throwback activity that some of us know and that we all love!  Create 'drawings'.  Save them.  Update them.  Delete them. Zen.

## Installation

To use this app, just clone the repo, navigate into the backend folder, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate`, run `rails s`, and then visit the index.html file (located in the frontend folder) in your web browser.
Everything should be set up!
